A set of programs for reading and extracting features from EDF format files
提取的特征有：最大值、最小值、中值、平均值、标准差、方差、平均绝对偏差、均方根、偏度、峰度,利用小波分解即可得到五种目标脑电信号波段，即δ波、θ波、α波、β波和γ波。
The extracted features are: maximum, minimum, median, mean, standard deviation, variance, mean absolute deviation, root mean square, skewness, kurtosis, and five target EEG signal bands can be obtained by wavelet decomposition, namely δ wave, θ wave, α wave, β wave and γ wave.
